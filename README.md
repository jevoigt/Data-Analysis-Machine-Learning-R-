# Data-Analysis-Machine-Learning-R-
This repository includes files across various assignments / projects within the Rstudio environment. 

These files are different scripts that display experience with data cleaning/manipulation, visualization, and analysis. There are also scripts that utilize 
different machine learning methods to pull insights and display knowledge within this area. 

Please note that much of this code was not originally intended to be provided for and/or used by anyone but myself or a professor, so please excuse any lack of 
comments within chunks of code, or possible work flow confusions. The restructuring of these files is a work in progress to make readability better so my work
can become more interpretable to anyone who would like to view these files. The inclusion of other files and projects is ongoing.
